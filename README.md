# Benefits Calculator

This is a simple application that businesses can utilize to calculate the total costs for providing benefits packages for their employees.

This implementation is going to be geared toward smaller businesses for now.

*Check out the live version here:* https://conorcook7.github.io/benefits-calculator/

## Getting Started

Here are the given constraints for this project:
* The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
* Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of
$500/year
* Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or
dependent
* All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
* There are 26 paychecks in a year


### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and updated on you machine.  Check current version with command `node -v` and that it is v10.16.0 or greater.


### Installing and Running Benefits Calculator Locally

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2. `cd` into project directory.
3. run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. run `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

*Additional Command*

1. `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.


## Current Issues  

This application is intended for smaller businesses. That would be the current downfall. In a future update I would like to add the functionality of being able to pass in a file of some kind and be able to correctly handle the input and provide the correct corresponding output.
